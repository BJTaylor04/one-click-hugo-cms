    Don't be a fucking moron, Donna. What are you going to do, drive around in a
    car like a polluting asshole, or take a safe, efficient train to get to your
    destination? Trains are the past, present, and future. Get on a train or get
    the fuck out of the way.

  heading: Our values
  text: >-
    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
